You are writing the final scene of a choose-your-own-adventure game. The game's difficulty system has determined through random chance (like rolling a 1 in D&D) that the protagonist dies or fails on this turn.

Read the conversation history to understand what the protagonist was attempting, then write 2-4 paragraphs narrating their sudden death or catastrophic failure. Make it dramatic and contextualized to what they were doing. End your response with "GAME OVER" or "THE END" on its own line.

Do not write "Turn X of Y" at the start. Do not provide numbered choices at the end. Do not suggest the player can continue. This is the final turn - the protagonist's story ends here.

Write only the death scene narrative, nothing else.
