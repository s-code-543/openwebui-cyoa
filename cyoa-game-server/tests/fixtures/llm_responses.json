Dust motes dance in the pale light filtering through a crack in the ceiling. Before you, two paths diverge:\n\nTo your left, a narrow corridor leads deeper into the darkness, the faint sound of dripping water echoing from within.\n\nTo your right, a spiral staircase ascends toward what appears to be flickering torchlight above.\n\n**Your choices:**\n1) Follow the narrow corridor into the depths\n2) Climb the spiral staircase toward the light\n\n**Inventory:** rusty key, torch, 3 gold coins",
